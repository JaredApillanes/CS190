## 1 - The Sound of a Name
Exploring basic user-input, sound file playback, and basic pitch modification along an adjustable pentatonic scale. This program plays a single [D4 guitar string sample](https://music.arts.uci.edu/dobrian/maxcookbook/file/guitarstringszip) upon letter input. The root of the scale is set by interpreting the ascii number of uppercase letters as a midi note. Ascii values of subsequent lowercase keystrokes are subtracted from the root letter and interpreted as steps away from the root on a pentatonic scale. Finally, the required playback speed is calculated, and the sample is output.
