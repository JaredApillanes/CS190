# JARED APILLANES - *Work in Computer Audio and Music Programming*

## 1 - The Sound of a Name
Exploring basic user-input, sound file playback, and basic pitch modification along an adjustable pentatonic scale. This program plays a single [D4 guitar string sample](https://music.arts.uci.edu/dobrian/maxcookbook/file/guitarstringszip) upon letter input. The root of the scale is set by interpreting the ascii number of uppercase letters as a midi note. Ascii values of subsequent lowercase keystrokes are subtracted from the root letter and interpreted as steps away from the root on a pentatonic scale. Finally, the required playback speed is calculated, and the sample is output.

## 2 - emiT
This project explores the randomization of LFO frequencies, custom distributions and gradients, pitch selection, and file speed within a reverse-time sound space. A randomly selected, sliding LFO is used as tremolo for a randomly pitch shifted sound file that is played back at a variable speed. Upon looping, all parameters are randomized, including the selected sound file.

## 3 - Control
This project aimed to map synthesizer controls an XBox controller. Vibrato, tremolo, pitch, envelope, and playback speed were all mapped to buttons, triggers, and sticks, with the latter two providing intuitive control over continuous domains.

## 4 - Scales
This project implements an old idea from another course. It explores randomness by generating random intervals and pitches and interpolates from the current position across a given scale. Improving the musicality of the tempo and rhythm selection would be an interesting path to explore in the future.
