# JARED APILLANES - *Work in Computer Audio and Music Programming*

## 1 - The Sound of a Name
Exploring basic user-input, sound file playback, and basic pitch modification along an adjustable pentatonic scale. This program plays a single [D4 guitar string sample](https://music.arts.uci.edu/dobrian/maxcookbook/file/guitarstringszip) upon letter input. The root of the scale is set by interpreting the ascii number of uppercase letters as a midi note. Ascii values of subsequent lowercase keystrokes are subtracted from the root letter and interpreted as steps away from the root on a pentatonic scale. Finally, the required playback speed is calculated, and the sample is output.

## 2 - emiT
This project explores the randomization of LFO frequencies, custom distributions and gradients, pitch selection, and file speed within a reverse-time sound space. A randomly selected, sliding LFO is used as tremolo for a randomly pitch shifted sound file that is played back at a variable speed. Upon looping, all parameters are randomized, including the selected sound file.
